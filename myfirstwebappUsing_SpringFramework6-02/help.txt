#This project is to remove the unwanted methods and doing authentication using Spring Security.

We have used PasswordEncoder implemented class BCryptPasswordEncoder for encoding the password
and as we are not used any database so we used InMemoryUserDetailsManager to create and store the
UserName and Password (User Credentials).
